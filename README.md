A syntax highlighting package for instaparse grammars. Developed using Monokai. All tweaks welcome. 

As context-free grammars have little relationship structurally to algol-derived programming languages, or markup,
the names of the rules have little bearing on the underlying syntax. I have endeavored for clarity in the "comment" 
field.
